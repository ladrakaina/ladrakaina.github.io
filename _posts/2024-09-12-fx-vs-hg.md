## Motivation ##

This article is to help me understand why one environment is better than another.

What we need from an environment is advantage. To me, this advantage translates to the following features of an environment:

+ Low cost of living

  It includes expenses on rent, food, and utilities.


+ Low population density

  The population includes both locals and tourists. Low population density means less noise, less disturbance, less competition, less attack. Therefore, I will have more advantage.
  
+ Longer winter

  Heat and long daytime can drain our energy, and make us less clear and less grounded. On the other hand, coldness and night help us stay calm and rested.

In this article, through visualization of their features, I want to compare two cities and the advantage I can potentially get from them.

 

## Cost of living ##

Figure 1 shows us the minimum cost of living in FX and HG. The cost of living in HG is 10% lower than FX mainly because of the lower rent there, which is highly probably caused by lower population density.

## Population density ##

From Figure 1 & 2, we can obviously see that HG not only has lower density of local residents than FX (55.87 vs. 177.4 people/square km), but also lower tourist density (445.87 1575.86 people/square km).

Due to the interplay between population density and economy, lower population density tends to indicate that the economy is less developed and there are less economical activities, such as businesses and tourism. This can be validated through the data on GDP (Figure 3), tourism income (Figure 4), and number of hotels (Figure 5).

## Length of winter ##

The length of winter is calculated through the number of months the indoor heating system is on. Due to the geolocations, HG, closer to the arctic circle, has a longer winter (October to April) than FX (November to March). Meanwhile, HG's highest temperature during summer is 84℉ (2024), while FX's is 93℉ (2024).

## Conclusion ##

Through the above analysis, we can obviously see, based on the features that are important to me (i.e. cost of living, population density, and the length of winter), HG is a better environment.
