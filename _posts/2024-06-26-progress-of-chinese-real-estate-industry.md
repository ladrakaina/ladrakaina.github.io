The real estate market of China accounts for a considerable share of her economy, however, it has been experiencing a crisis since last year. In this article, I want to review the market value changes of the Chinese real estate market.

First let's clarify a few definitions:

+ GDP: [gross domestic product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).
  
+ Market value: in this article it means the overall value of a industry, including products and services.

+ Market share: market value / GDP

Figure 1 shows that in the past 20 years (2004 - 2023), the progress of the market value of Chinese real estate.
